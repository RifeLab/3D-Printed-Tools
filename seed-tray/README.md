# Seed Tray

Use the Size Testers to determine your optimal hole size and adjust the paramters accordingly. We have included a number of generally-sized trays that worked for a number of genotypes we tested. However it is worth noting that many crop seed sizes are highly genotype specific.

| Parameter Name     | Suggested Value/Range | Notes |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----- |
| WallThickness | 3mm | Thickness of the walls of the tray; useful if you need a stronger print or you keep dropping the tray and breaking it |
| X_Count | 1-100                 | Multiply this value by Y_Count to determine the number of seeds your tray can hold |
| Y_Count | â‰¤ 15                  | Multiply this value by X_Count to determine the number of seeds your tray can hold |
| HoleSpacingWidth | HoleRX * 2.5 | The space between each hole in the tray; used to move the holes closer or further apart; adjust the number not the variable name |
| HoleSpacingLength | HoleRY * 2.5 | The space between each hole in the tray; used to move the holes closer or further apart; adjust the number not the variable name |
| HoleBodyDepth | ( 0.5 ) * HoleRadiusX | Often should be equal to HoleBottomDepth; useful for adjusting for non-round seeds |
| HoleBottomDepth | ( 0.5 ) * HoleRadiusX | Often should be equal to HoleBodyDepth; useful for adjusting for non-round seeds |
| HandWidth | 20mm | base this value on the size of your grip when holding something like broom handle |
| HandLength | 100mm |Easiest way to adjust the tray to fit your printer |
| HoleDiameterWidth | 0.2-7.0mm | Use the seed sizing squares or calipers to determine this value |
| HoleDiameterLength | 0.2-7.0mm | Use the seed sizing squares or calipers to determine this value |
