# Tube Holder

Use Figure 2 to know what to measure on your tube. Otherwise, hopefully the parameters are self-explanatory.

| Parameter Name | Suggested Value/Range | Notes |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| TubeDiameter | 10.6mm | Refer to Figure 2 for demonstration of what to measure using calipers |
| TubeRidgeHeight | 1.2mm | Refer to Figure 2 for demonstration of what to measure using calipers |
| Tolerance | 0.4mm | Adjust based on your printer's limitations |
| X_Count | 1-∞ | We don't suggest going above 10 |
| Y_Count | 1-∞ | We don't suggest going above 20 |
| GasketHeight | 2.4mm | You can go thinner, but in our tests this yielded the best grip on tubes without being too weak or strong |
