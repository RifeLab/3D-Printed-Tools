# Size Tester

Accurately sizing objects can impede the rapid prototyping process.
These sizing squares simplify the process of determining the optimal hole size for seeds and beads.
The ideal scoop size should allow seeds/beads to easily pass through the holes without getting caught.
This design is not parameterized, but we have provided all sizes between 0.4-7.0mm diameter.
